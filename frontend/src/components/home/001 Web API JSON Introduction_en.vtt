Hi and welcome to our web API is introduction course where we're going to be covering how to access

00:06.420 --> 00:14.400
Jason data make use of Jason data and make ajax requests to return content back and use it within your

00:14.400 --> 00:15.950
web application.

00:15.960 --> 00:20.040
My name is Lawrence and I'm excited to be the instructor for this course.

00:20.040 --> 00:22.140
I really enjoy working with JavaScript.

00:22.140 --> 00:28.620
I come to you with 20 years of web development javascript experience connecting to web API is is a essential

00:28.620 --> 00:31.550
part of being able to build web applications.

00:31.620 --> 00:36.660
And I'm going to be showing you how you can connect to various Web APIs throughout the upcoming lesson.

00:36.690 --> 00:44.730
Source Code is also included as well as this handy PDA f guide that is meant to supplement the course

00:44.790 --> 00:50.880
content and walk you through the various lessons that are up and coming including some useful links

00:50.910 --> 00:57.390
resources and source code as well as most lessons will have a challenge for you to try the code out

00:57.690 --> 01:04.980
see what you can do with JavaScript javascript each team LCROSS are prerequisites to this course as

01:04.980 --> 01:12.390
this course is focused on JavaScript objects Jason and making ajax requests and anything related to

01:12.450 --> 01:19.110
ajax requests with JavaScript we're gonna be covering what JavaScript objects are with JavaScript arrays

01:19.110 --> 01:24.300
are with plenty of examples how we can iterate through the array contents how can it iterate through

01:24.330 --> 01:31.050
object contents and then getting Jason data and passing and string refining that data into usable objects

01:31.170 --> 01:36.150
and then it's going to come to the fun part where we're going to be connecting to using content files

01:36.450 --> 01:43.080
in order to output data into our application there is an explanation about how to use fetch as well

01:43.110 --> 01:51.330
as how to create Jason bins online that you can connect to and practice making ajax requests to and

01:51.330 --> 01:57.180
pulling that data back into your web applications and then also using fetch in a number of different

01:57.180 --> 02:05.250
ways connecting to data that's on your server itself as a Jason File and then also using fetch with

02:05.250 --> 02:11.970
the arrow function expressions and then we're going to connect to various Web APIs to really get lots

02:11.970 --> 02:19.110
of practice and get familiar with connecting various Jason data and then iterating through and looping

02:19.110 --> 02:22.010
through that data in order to output it into our page.

02:22.080 --> 02:31.350
So this includes using random user API the Reddit post API get hub repo API Stack Overflow API and then

02:31.350 --> 02:38.670
also connected to Google Sheet data also how you can output your own Google Sheet data as Jason File

02:38.910 --> 02:44.190
and connect to it with your web application and bring the data into your web application and there's

02:44.190 --> 02:50.290
a number of challenges throat and also showing you how you can post data using fetch and then retrieve

02:50.310 --> 02:57.990
back those posts and page me through a bunch of Jason data creating an interactive web application Source

02:57.990 --> 03:03.360
Code is include a layout of the lessons is that the source code is going to be on the left hand side

03:03.750 --> 03:09.710
within the editor and on the right hand side you're going to be able to see the code in action within

03:09.720 --> 03:16.620
the Chrome browser using console quite a bit if you have any questions or comments I'm always happy

03:16.620 --> 03:19.100
to hear you in the Q and A section of the course.

03:19.230 --> 03:22.140
So let's dive right in and start coding some javascript.
